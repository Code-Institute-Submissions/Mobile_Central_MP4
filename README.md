## UX

There types of clientele sought are two : 

* enthusiast mobiles users who are always up to date with latest technologies and fashonable items on the market, these are prepared to spend a substantial amount of money for a well rounded product.
* common mobiles users who see the product more as a neccessity than a fancy thing to have; they will settle for a product that meet their minimal expectations with the least inpact on their finances. 

The website addresses the needs of both with a division in two main categories amd with a clear display of products from each in the landing page. Product descriptions and reviews are available to allow customers to make an informed decision. 
Customers can make specific queries via contact form.
